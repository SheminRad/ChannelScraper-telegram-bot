['“And once the storm is over, you won’t remember how you made it through, how you managed to survive. You won’t even be sure, whether the storm is really over. But one thing is certain. When you come out of the storm, you won’t be the same person who walked in. That’s what this storm’s all about.”\n\n― Haruki Murakami, Kafka on the Shore', '"The more a man lays stress on false possessions, and the less sensitivity he has for what is essential, the less satisfying is his life. He feels limited because he has limited aims, and the result is envy and jealousy." - C.G. Jung', "“You only have power over people as long as you don't take everything away from them. But when you've robbed a man of everything, he's no longer in your power—he's free again.”\n\n― Alexander Solzhenitsyn", '"Any organization created out of fear must create fear to survive."\n\n- Bill Hicks', 'https://vimeo.com/384489349', 'https://vimeo.com/48425421', 'https://vimeo.com/channels/staffpicks/303380455', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJFI53qZ7xY', 'https://youtu.be/dt9GBafFzjE', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2HtvFJqCQt4', '"I want to make a complaint against my parents.

Life is a bitch.I thought we\'d become good people, loved by all. But God doesn\'t want that for us. He\'d rather we be washrags for others.
